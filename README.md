Welcome to your ready-to-go plug and play Machine Teaching (MT) framework code-base!

This repository has everything you need to build a MT framework from scratch, including:
  1) Helpful abstract classes helping you focus on the functionality each of the components should implement.
  2) Handy implementations of each of the components so you get a feel for how they interact with each other
  3) 1.2.3... Demo! This script is a ready to run. Just press play to get a working demo of existing MT frameworks implemented within the code-base.
     Using this script you can switch different implementations within the code-base and easily evaluate the results of different implementations.


To run this code simply clone the repository and run the PlugAndPlay.py script.
